# Using Rust Importer

WaaS allows you to directly compile `*.rs` files to WebAssembly by importing them as assets.

:::info
To use Rust Importer, you need the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the [`wasm32-unknown-unknown`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-unknown-unknown.html#building-rust-programs) target.

## Import Settings

<center>
    <img src={rustImporterImage} width="400" />
</center>

- **Create Root**: Specify whether to treat the source file as the root of the crate. If unchecked, the source file will not be compiled directly to WebAssembly, but can be referenced as a module from other source files.
- **Dependencies**: Specify the packages to depend on.
  - **via Registry**: Install packages from the package registry.
  - **via Git**: Install packages from a Git repository.
- **Componentize**: Convert the WebAssembly module to a component. See [Componentization](#componentization) for details.

### Dependency

- **Name**: Specify the package name.
- **Version Requirements**: Specify the version. See [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html) for details.

### via Registry Specific Items

- **Registry** (optional): Specify the registry to get the package from. See [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-other-registries) for details.

### via Git Specific Items

- **Git Url**: Specify the URL of the Git repository.
- **Branch** (optional): Specify the branch name.
- **Tag** (optional): Specify the tag name or commit hash.
- **Rev** (optional): Specify the commit hash.

:::warning
Rust Importer automatically recompiles when it detects changes in the source file. However, changes are not detected in the following cases:

- When the dependent source file is outside of Unity's management
- When dependent source file does not exist, and the corresponding source file is created or modified after a compilation error
- When it depends on files other than `.rs`

In these cases, right-click the target source file and select `Reimport` to recompile it.  
Also, selecting `Assets` > `Recompile Rust scripts for WaaS` recompiles all Rust source files in the project.
:::

### Using Presets

You can save the above settings as a **Preset Asset** for reuse.

Crate a preset asset with `Create` > `WaaS` > `Rust Importer Preset` then set it to the **Preset** field in the Rust Importer settings.

## Using IDE functionality

Open the root folder of the project as a workspace with the IDE which supports Rust, and you can use the IDE's features such as code completion and syntax highlighting.

WaaS acomplishes this by generating a `Cargo.toml` file in the project root directory:

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["Library/com.ruccho.waas/rust/crates/*"] # Used by WaaS
resolver = "2" # Used by WaaS

```

Internally, Rust Importer generates crates under `Library/com.ruccho.waas/rust/crates/*` for each source file with **Crate Root** checked. `Cargo.toml` files generated for each crate cannot be modified by hand because they are overwritten when the Rust Importer settings are changed.

## Disabling Rust Importer

To disable Rust Importer, use `WAAS_DISABLE_RUST_IMPORTER` define symbol.

## Componentization

:::info
Refer to [Component Model Tutorial](../getting-started/component-model) for more information on componentization.

## Best Practices

### Version Control

It is recommended to add `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` at the root of the project to version control.

### Using wee_alloc

[wee_alloc](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc) is an allocator for WebAssembly with small code size.

Add `wee_alloc` to the dependencies and write the following:

```rust
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: wee_alloc::WeeAlloc = wee_alloc::WeeAlloc::INIT;
```

### Build Settings

We can add options to optimize the code size to `Cargo.toml` at the root of the project:

```toml
## ...

[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "z"
```

:::info
Currently, Rust Importer always uses `--release` profile to compile.
