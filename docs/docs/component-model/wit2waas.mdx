# Using `wit2waas`

`wit2waas` is a CLI tool that converts interfaces defined in WIT to C# interface definitions.  
By combining it with [Binding Generator](./binding-generator/), you can easily handle interfaces written in WIT on C#.

### Installation

Install `wit2waas` with the following command after installing [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```sh
cargo install wit2waas
```

### Usage

#### Configuration of WIT

Save WIT in the following directory structure in advance.

```
- wit
  - <your wit>.wit
  - <your wit>.wit
  - <your wit>.wit
  - deps
    - <dependency package>
      - <dependency>.wit
      - <dependency>.wit
    - <dependency package>
    - <dependency package>
```

:::info
You can configure package dependencies from package registries, etc. using tools such as [`wit-deps`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-deps).

#### Running `wit2waas`

Next, run `wit2waas` in a directory containing the `wit` folder.

```sh
wit2waas
```

The result will be output to the `out` folder. Place `*.cs` contained in it in your C# project.

### Options

```sh
$ wit2waas --help
