WaaS is a script engine for Unity / .NET.

WaaS stands for **WebAssembly as a Script**, which adopts WebAssembly as a script execution format.

This has the following benefits:

#### Language independence

> Various languages that [support output to WebAssembly](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs) such as Rust, C/C++, Java, and Go can be used, allowing you to choose the language that best suits your needs.

#### Security

> Without explicit permission, WebAssembly code cannot access the host environment's memory or functions.
> You can also run untrusted scripts safely.

#### Portability

> It is a full Pure C# implementation and can run anywhere Unity or .NET supports.

#### Interpreter

> It does not require JIT or AOT compilation of WebAssembly itself.
> You can run scripts obtained at runtime even on platforms where JIT is prohibited, such as iOS.

#### Binding

> It supports the [Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) and allows you to perform practical bindings.

### Use cases

#### As a simple script in a game

> It can be used as a script to describe events and AI in a game.
> By creating scripts in small units, you can achieve fast hot reloads.

#### As user-created content

> It can be used as a script to give complex behavior to user-created content.

#### As a plugin system

> It can be used as a script to add plugins to applications created with Unity or .NET.
